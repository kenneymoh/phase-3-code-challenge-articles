# ARTICLES - WITHOUT AR
## DESCRIPTION

For this challenge, we are working with a Magazine domain.

We have three models: Author, Article, and Magazine.

For our purposes, an Author has many Articles, a Magazine has many Articles, and Articles belong to both Author and Magazine.

## BDD
The magazine domain has three model class inputs: Author, Article, Magazine and their methods. Which are then supposed to output the data required by the user.
